### üéØ Project Overview

Pokedex is an interactive web application built using React.js that allows users to search and learn more about their favorite Pokemon. The application leverages the comprehensive [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display detailed information about each Pokemon, including their types, abilities, stats, and more.

Each Pokemon has a dedicated page with more detailed data, providing users with a deep dive into their favorite Pokemon's abilities. The search feature enhances the user experience by allowing quick and easy navigation to the Pokemon of interest.
